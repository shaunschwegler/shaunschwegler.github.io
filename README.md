# About

Its not done. I'll probs use it for my CV at some point in the future idk.

Msg me on [[Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/shaunschwegler.svg?style=social&label=twttr%20%40shaunschwegler)](https://twitter.com/shaunschwegler) to get in touch w me. :)

Update: Done a CV, [check it out](https://shaunschwegler.github.io/cv "Curriculum Vitae"). Still yet to do a blog or 'about' section. Not sure if I'll actually do an 'About page seems as though the CV already covers the basis of who I am in the context of my professional life. Either way the whole feature will come as V1.1.
